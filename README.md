# p-radials

A radial equipment and item menu SKSE plugin for **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition / VR Edition**, built with [CommonLibSSE-NG](https://github.com/alandtse/CommonLibSSE-NG).

## Requirements

- Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition / VR Edition
- Address Library for SKSE Plugins

## Installation

Automatic install with Vortex or ModOrganizer2 or manually:

Copy the binary file `p-radials.dll` and the folder `p-radials` to
		`SKYRIM_FOLDER\Data\SKSE\Plugins\`
		
	The main configuration .ini file is located in `\p-radials\p-radials.ini`
	
	Translations should be located in `\p-radials\languages`
	Icons can be modified in folder `\p-radials\icons`
	Radial formats are saved in `\p-radials\radials`
	Layouts with positions and colors are saved in `\p-radials\layouts`

## Controls

All bindings can be changed from **Settings**. `First Key`,
`Second Key`, and `Alt Config Key` have no fixed keyboard default in this
table because they are user-configurable.

| Open WheelSettings | Hold an activation key and use the configuration gesture, or press **Alt Config Key** | Press the configured **Alt Config Key**, or use the configured settings shortcut |
| Select and use an item | Move the cursor over the item, then click the applicable mouse button | Move selection with the stick / D-pad, then use **A** or **X** |
| Cycle items in a radial | **Mouse wheel** | **D-pad**, **L1**, or **R1** depending on the active radial |
| Move an item in WheelSettings | Drag with **Left Mouse Button** | Select with **A/X**, then navigate with the D-pad |
